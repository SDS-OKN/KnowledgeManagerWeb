The purpose of this application was to demonstrate viewing one or more ontologies and viewing querying results.   
You will need to install the server side components from the KMDestop/SDSOKN/SDSOknServerServices and have either Allegrograph or similar server.
The key elements left would be to build an installer, continue the integration of the different views, connect the NLP to a more robust client, and to remove any ESRI linkage.
